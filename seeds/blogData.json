          "articleBody": "Women have been underrepresented in the tech industry for a long time. Despite the progress that has been made in recent years, women still make up only a small portion of tech workers. This is an issue that needs to be addressed if we are to create an inclusive and diverse tech industry.Breaking into the tech industry can be difficult for women due to a lack of access to resources and networks, as well as gender stereotypes and bias. However, there are many ways that women can break into tech. These include attending networking events, building relationships with mentors, taking advantage of online learning opportunities, and joining organizations dedicated to supporting women in tech. With the right resources and support, more women can break into this traditionally male-dominated field and become leaders in their respective fields."

          "articleBody": "The representation of ethnic minority women in the sector has been underrepresented. In recent years, there have been efforts to increase diversity in tech and make it more inclusive for all genders and ethnicities. However, there is still a long way to go before we can truly say that the industry is diverse and inclusive. One of the biggest challenges facing ethnic minority women in tech is lack of access to resources, networks, and opportunities that are essential for success in the field. This lack of access can be attributed to systemic racism, unconscious bias, and other forms of discrimination that persist within the industry. As such, it is important that we continue to work towards making tech more accessible for everyone so that everyone can benefit from its potential."
